```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This password MUST be changed on first login!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Login Flow:**

```
1. User logs in with admin@circuvent.com
   ↓
2. Dashboard detects admin user
   ↓
3. Admin panel auto-opens
   ↓
4. Welcome toast appears: "Welcome Admin! Opening Admin Panel..." 🛡️
   ↓
5. Wait 2 seconds
   ↓
6. Check localStorage:
   - adminPasswordChanged? → Skip modal
   - adminPasswordChangeSkipped? → Skip modal
   - Neither? → Show modal
   ↓
7. Password change modal appears
   ↓
8. User changes password or skips
   ↓
9. If changed: Save to localStorage, show success
   If skipped: Save skip flag, show warning
   ↓
10. Admin panel ready to use
```

### **Password Validation:**

```javascript
// Real-time validation as user types
validatePassword(password) {
  - Check length >= 8
  - Check for uppercase letter
  - Check for lowercase letter  
  - Check for number
  - Check for special character
  - Return errors array
}

// Strength calculation
- 0 errors = Strong (100%) → Green
- 1-2 errors = Medium (60%) → Yellow
- 3+ errors = Weak (30%) → Red
```

## 🎨 Visual Features

### **Modal Design:**

```

**Clear to reset:**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('adminPasswordChanged');
localStorage.removeItem('adminPasswordChangeSkipped');
```

## 🔧 Backend Integration (Next Steps)

### **API Endpoint to Create:**

```javascript
// POST /api/auth/change-password
{
  currentPassword: "admin@001",
  newPassword: "Admin@2025!"
}

// Server should:
1. Verify JWT token
2. Check user is admin
3. Validate current password (bcrypt.compare)
4. Validate new password requirements
5. Hash new password (bcrypt.hash)
6. Update database
7. Log the change
8. Send confirmation email
9. Return success response
```

### **Security Middleware:**
```javascript
// Protect route
router.post('/change-password', 
  authenticateToken,
  isAdmin,
  validatePasswordStrength,
  rateLimit,
  changePassword
);
```
