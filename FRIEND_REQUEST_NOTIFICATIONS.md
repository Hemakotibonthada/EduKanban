# Friend Request Notifications - Implementation Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Friend Request Sent - Notification to Receiver**

When User A sends a friend request to User B:

**What happens:**
- ✅ Notification is created in database
- ✅ Real-time Socket.IO event is emitted to User B
- ✅ User B sees notification in NotificationCenter bell icon
- ✅ Toast notification appears on User B's screen
- ✅ Notification badge shows unread count

**Notification Details:**
```javascript
{
  type: 'friend_request',
  title: 'New Friend Request',
  message: 'John Doe sent you a friend request',
  priority: 'normal',
  actionUrl: '/chat?tab=friends'
}
```

**Data stored:**
- Friend request ID
- Sender's username
- Connection reason (why they want to connect)

---

### 2. **Friend Request Accepted - Notification to Sender**

When User B accepts User A's friend request:

**What happens:**
- ✅ Notification is created for User A (original sender)
- ✅ Real-time Socket.IO event is emitted
- ✅ User A sees notification in NotificationCenter
- ✅ Toast notification appears
- ✅ Direct link to the new conversation

**Notification Details:**
```javascript
{
  type: 'friend_request',
  title: 'Friend Request Accepted',
  message: 'Jane Smith accepted your friend request',
  priority: 'normal',
  actionUrl: '/chat?conversationId=abc123'
}
```

**Additional Actions:**
- Both users added to each other's friends list
- Direct conversation is created automatically
- Notification includes link to start chatting immediately

---

### 3. **Friend Request Rejected - Optional Notification**

When User B rejects User A's friend request:

**What happens:**
- ⚠️ Notification is **commented out** by default for privacy
- You can enable it by uncommenting the code in `chatEnhanced.js`

**Why it's optional:**
- Privacy consideration - not everyone wants to know they were rejected
- Reduces potential awkwardness
- Prevents notification spam

**To enable rejection notifications:**
Uncomment lines in `/backend/routes/chatEnhanced.js` around line 209
