## 🚀 Quick Tests

### Test 1: Message Persistence (2 minutes)

**Setup**: Open chat with a friend

**Steps**:
1. Send a message: "Test message 1"
2. Right-click → "Delete for Me"
3. ✅ **You**: Message disappears
4. ✅ **Friend**: Still sees the message

5. Send another message: "Test message 2"
6. Right-click → "Delete for Everyone"
7. ✅ **Both**: Message disappears
8. ✅ **Database**: Message still exists (check MongoDB)

**Verify in MongoDB**:
```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or shell
db.directmessages.find({ content: "Test message 1" })

// Should return the message with:
// { deletedFor: [your_user_id] }
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Messages deleted permanently

**Check**:
1. Look at API request in Network tab
2. Should be: `DELETE /api/chat-enhanced/messages/:id`
3. Response should include the message object
4. Query MongoDB to confirm message exists

**Fix**: Already implemented - no action needed!

### Problem: Friend shows offline when online

**Check**:
1. **Backend Console**: Look for "marked as online"
   - Missing? → Socket.IO connection failed
   
2. **Frontend Console**: Look for "Connected to chat server"
   - Missing? → Check API_URL configuration
   
3. **Network Tab**: Check WebSocket connection
   - Should see: `ws://localhost:5001/socket.io/...`
   - Status: 101 Switching Protocols

**Fix**: Already implemented! The system now:
- Initializes online status from database on page load
- Syncs with real-time Socket.IO events
- Refreshes status list on reconnection

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### How to Test on Phone:

1. **Find Your Local IP**:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Example output: `192.168.1.13`

2. **Access on Phone**:
   - Frontend: `http://192.168.1.13:3000`
   - Backend: `http://192.168.1.13:5001`

3. **Ensure Phone is on Same WiFi** as your laptop

4. **Test Multi-Device**:
   - Login on laptop
   - Login on phone (same account or different)
   - Check online status shows correctly on both
