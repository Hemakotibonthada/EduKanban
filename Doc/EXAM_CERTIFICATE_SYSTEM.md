## System Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models

**Exam Model** (`backend/models/Exam.js`)
- **Purpose**: Stores exam structure and questions
- **Key Fields**:
  - `courseId`: Reference to the course
  - `moduleId`: Optional reference to specific module (null for final exams)
  - `title`: Exam title
  - `description`: Exam description
  - `questions`: Array of question objects with:
    - `questionText`: The question
    - `type`: 'multiple-choice', 'true-false', 'short-answer'
    - `options`: Array of answer options with `text` and `isCorrect`
    - `correctAnswer`: The correct answer text
    - `explanation`: Explanation of the correct answer
    - `category`: Topic/module category for weak area analysis

  - `attemptsAllowed`: Number of attempts permitted (default: 3)
  - `isActive`: Whether the exam is currently available

**ExamAttempt Model** (`backend/models/ExamAttempt.js`)
- **Purpose**: Records user exam attempts and results
- **Key Fields**:
  - `userId`, `examId`, `courseId`, `moduleId`: References
  - `answers`: Array of user answers with correctness and points
  - `score`: Points earned

  - `examPassed`: Boolean indicating if user passed the exam

#### 2. API Routes

**Exam Routes** (`backend/routes/exams.js`)

```
GET /api/exams/course/:courseId
- Get all exams for a course
- Returns exams without correct answers
- Requires authentication

GET /api/exams/:examId
- Get specific exam details
- Includes user's previous attempts
- Shows attempts remaining
- Returns exam without correct answers

POST /api/exams/:examId/attempts
- Submit exam attempt
- Request body: { answers, startedAt, timeSpent }
- Validates attempt limit
- Grades exam automatically
- Updates associated task status
- Returns detailed results with weak areas

GET /api/exams/:examId/attempts/user
- Get user's attempts for an exam
- Returns summary of all attempts

GET /api/exams/attempts/:attemptId
- Get detailed results for specific attempt
- Includes question-by-question breakdown
```

#### 3. Services

**CourseTemplateService Updates** (`backend/services/CourseTemplateService.js`)

New Methods:
- `generateCourseExam(courseId, userId)`: Creates final exam for course
- `generateExamQuestionsWithAI(course)`: Uses OpenAI to generate smart questions
- `generateTemplateExamQuestions(course)`: Fallback template-based questions

Integration:
- `createPersonalizedCourse()` now automatically generates final exam
- Exam generation is non-blocking (course creation succeeds even if exam fails)

**Exam Grading Logic**

Located in `backend/routes/exams.js` as helper function:

```javascript
function gradeExam(exam, userAnswers) {
  // 1. Process each answer
  // 2. Calculate score and percentage
  // 3. Track performance by category
  // 4. Identify weak areas (>40% incorrect in a category)
  // 5. Generate remediation suggestions
  // 6. Return comprehensive results
}
```

Weak Area Detection:
- Categories with >40% incorrect answers flagged as weak
- >60% incorrect triggers additional remediation suggestions
- Suggestions include:
  - Review fundamentals
  - Practice more exercises
  - Study examples and case studies
  - Revisit entire module (for severe weakness)
  - Seek additional resources or tutoring

## Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

### Components Needed

1. **ExamPage.jsx**
   - Display exam questions
   - Timer countdown
   - Answer selection interface
   - Submit exam functionality
   - Results display

2. **ExamResultsModal.jsx**
   - Show score and percentage
   - Display pass/fail status
   - List weak areas with remediation suggestions
   - Retry button (if failed)
   - Certificate button (if passed)

3. **EnhancedKanbanBoard.jsx Updates**
   - Intercept task status changes from 'review' to 'completed'
   - Check if `examRequired` is true
   - Open exam modal
   - Handle exam results:
     - **Pass**: Mark task complete, generate certificate
     - **Fail**: Move task back to 'review', show remediation

## Task-Exam Integration Flow

1. **Course Creation**:
   ```
   User creates course
   → CourseTemplateService.createPersonalizedCourse()
   → Generates tasks via createTasksFromTemplate()
   → Generates final exam via generateCourseExam()
   → Creates final project task with examRequired=true
   ```

2. **Taking the Exam**:
   ```
   User moves final project to 'review'
   → Frontend detects task.examRequired
   → Opens ExamPage with task.examId
   → User completes exam
   → Submits to POST /api/exams/:examId/attempts
   → Backend grades and updates task
   ```

3. **Exam Results**:
   - **Pass (≥70%)**:
     - Task status → 'completed'
     - ExamAttempt.passed → true
     - Task.examPassed → true
     - Certificate generated
     - User can download certificate
   
   - **Fail (<70%)**:
     - Task status → 'review'
     - ExamAttempt.passed → false
     - Weak areas identified
     - Remediation suggestions displayed
     - User can retry (up to 3 attempts)

4. **Retaking Exam**:
   ```
   User clicks retry
   → Checks attemptsRemaining
   → If available: Opens ExamPage again
   → If exhausted: Show message, require admin reset
   ```

## Certificate Generation Integration

After passing exam:

```javascript
// In backend/routes/certificates.js
POST /api/certificates/generate

{
  "courseId": "68f2375148b050a3c3c7b014",
  "examAttemptId": "68f237b5b050a3c3c7b020"
}

// Certificate created with:
- percentage from exam attempt
- examAttempt reference
- weakAreasAddressed tracking
- unique certificateId and verificationCode
```

## Benefits of the System

1. **Automated Assessment**: Exams generated automatically with course creation
2. **Smart Weak Area Detection**: Identifies specific topics needing review
3. **Adaptive Learning**: Remediation suggestions guide focused study
4. **Progress Tracking**: Multiple attempts tracked with detailed analytics
5. **Certificate Validation**: Certificates linked to actual exam performance
6. **Fair Evaluation**: Standardized passing criteria (70%)
7. **Flexible Retry System**: Up to 3 attempts with targeted feedback

## Security Features
