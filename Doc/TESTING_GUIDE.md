socket.emit('get_online_users')
```

### Monitor Network Requests
```

2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter: WS (WebSocket)
4. See Socket.IO messages in real-time
5. Check API calls under XHR
```

### Database Queries
```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
mongosh

// Use EduKanban database
use edukanban

// Check friend requests
db.friendrequests.find().pretty()

// Check messages
db.directmessages.find().sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(10).pretty()

// Check communities
db.communities.find().pretty()

// Check files
db.fileattachments.find().pretty()

// Check online users (not in DB, in-memory Map)
