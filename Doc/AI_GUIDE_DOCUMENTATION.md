  details: {
    userMessage: message,
    aiResponse: aiResponse.substring(0, 200)
  },
  metadata: {
    messageLength: message.length,
    responseLength: aiResponse.length,
    userAgent: req.get('User-Agent'),
    ipAddress: req.ip
  }
});
```

## üí° AI Response Examples

### Study Tips Query
**User:** "Give me study tips"

**AI Response:**
```
Great question about learning! Here are some proven study techniques:

1. **Active Recall** - Test yourself regularly instead of just re-reading
2. **Spaced Repetition** - Review material at increasing intervals
3. **Pomodoro Technique** - Study in 25-minute focused sessions
4. **Teach Others** - Explaining concepts solidifies your understanding
5. **Take Breaks** - Your brain needs rest to consolidate information

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these techniques?
```

### Career Advice Query
**User:** "What career paths are available in tech?"

**AI Response:**
```
Career planning is exciting! Here's my advice:

**For Tech Careers:**
- Build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals
- Create a portfolio of projects showcasing your skills
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Network with professionals in your field
- Stay updated with industry trends

**General Career Tips:**
- Focus on continuous learning
- Develop both technical and soft skills
- Seek mentorship and guidance
- Don't be afraid to start small and grow

What specific career path interests you?
```

### Concept Explanation Query
**User:** "Explain machine learning"

**AI (when OpenAI available):**
```
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables 
computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Here's how it works:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data
2. **Training**: Feed data to algorithms that identify patterns
3. **Model Creation**: Build a model based on learned patterns
4. **Prediction**: Use the model to make predictions on new data

Think of it like teaching a child to recognize animals by showing them 
many pictures - eventually, they can identify animals they've never 
seen before!

Common applications:
- Email spam filtering
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify)
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Self-driving cars

Would you like to know more about a specific type of machine learning?
```

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- User messages are logged (truncated to 200 chars for AI response)
- No sensitive user information exposed to AI
- Activity logs include anonymized metadata
- API endpoints require authentication

### Rate Limiting (Recommended)
```javascript
// Future enhancement
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const aiChatLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 50, // 50 requests per window
  message: 'Too many AI requests, please try again later'
});

router.post('/chat', aiChatLimiter, [...]);
```

---

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Response Time
- **OpenAI**: 2-5 seconds average
- **Fallback**: < 100ms
- Loading state shown during wait

### Optimization
- Messages stored in component state (not persisted)
- No database queries for message history
- Lightweight fallback responses
- Minimal API calls

### Scalability
- Stateless endpoint (scales horizontally)
- No session storage required
- Can handle concurrent users
- Future: Add caching for common questions
