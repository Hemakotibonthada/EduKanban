# Tasks & Profile Updates - October 17, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Tasks Not Showing in Kanban Board
**Problem:** Tasks were not appearing in the todo, in-progress, review, or completed columns.

**Root Cause:** 
- Task model was using capitalized statuses: 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Skipped', 'Completed'
- New EnhancedKanbanBoard expects lowercase statuses: 'todo', 'in-progress', 'review', 'completed'
- Task creation was using lowercase 'todo' but model enum didn't include it

**Solution:**
- Updated Task model enum to include both old and new status values for backward compatibility
- Added 'urgent' to priority enum (was missing)
- Tasks now work with both naming conventions

### 2. Profile Photo Upload Not Working
**Problem:** Camera button on profile page was non-functional.

**Solution:**
- Added profile picture upload functionality to ProfilePage.jsx
- Created backend endpoint: `POST /api/users/profile-picture`
- Implemented multer file upload with:
  - Image validation (jpeg, jpg, png, gif, webp)
  - 5MB file size limit
  - Automatic file organization in `/uploads/profile-pictures/`
- Added profile picture display with fallback to initials
- Added loading state during upload
- Created delete endpoint: `DELETE /api/users/profile-picture`

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Task Model (`backend/models/Task.js`)
