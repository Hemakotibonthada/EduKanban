# Password Reset Implementation

## Overview
Complete password reset functionality has been implemented for the EduKanban platform. Users can now reset their forgotten passwords through a secure token-based flow.

## Features Implemented

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

#### 1. User Model Updates
**File**: `backend/models/User.js`
- Added `resetPasswordToken` field (hashed token storage)
- Added `resetPasswordExpires` field (1 hour expiration)

#### 2. Password Reset Endpoints
**File**: `backend/routes/auth.js`

##### POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`
- Accepts email address
- Generates secure reset token (crypto.randomBytes)
- Stores hashed token in database
- Sets 1-hour expiration
- Logs the attempt in AuthLog
- Returns success message (doesn't reveal if user exists)
- In development mode: Returns token and reset URL in response

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "If an account with that email exists, a password reset link has been sent.",
  "resetToken": "abc123..." // Only in development
  "resetUrl": "http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=abc123..." // Only in development
}
```

##### POST `/api/auth/reset-password`
- Accepts reset token and new password
- Validates token and expiration
- Updates user password (bcrypt hashed)
- Clears reset token fields
- Logs successful reset in AuthLog

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "token": "reset-token-from-url",
  "newPassword": "newSecurePassword123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password has been reset successfully. You can now login with your new password."
}
```

### Frontend (React)

#### 1. Forgot Password Page
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx`
- Beautiful UI with Framer Motion animations
- Email input field
- Success confirmation screen
- Loading states
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Shows dev reset URL in development mode

#### 2. Reset Password Page
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ResetPasswordPage.jsx`
- Extracts token from URL parameters
- Two password fields (new password + confirm)
- Password visibility toggles
- Password strength requirements display
- Success confirmation with auto-redirect
- Automatically redirects to login after successful reset

#### 3. AuthPage Updates
**File**: `frontend/src/components/AuthPage.jsx`
- Added "Forgot Password?" link on login form
- Positioned below password field
- Styled to match the existing design

#### 4. App.jsx Integration
**File**: `frontend/App.jsx`
- Added lazy-loaded routes for password reset pages
- URL parameter detection for reset tokens
- View state management for forgot/reset password flows
- Proper navigation between states

## User Flow

### 1. Forgot Password Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. Enters email address on forgot password page
3. Submits form
4. Receives confirmation message
5. **In Development**: Reset URL is displayed and logged to console
6. **In Production**: Email would be sent (requires email service integration)

### 2. Reset Password Flow
1. User clicks reset link (from email or console in dev)
2. Lands on reset password page with token in URL
3. Enters new password twice
4. Submits form
5. Password is updated in database
6. Success message displayed
7. Auto-redirected to login page after 3 seconds

## Security Features

### Token Security
- **Crypto-secure random tokens**: Using `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- **Token hashing**: Tokens are hashed with SHA-256 before storage
- **Time-limited**: Tokens expire after 1 hour
- **Single use**: Tokens are cleared after successful reset
- **No user enumeration**: Same response whether email exists or not

### Password Security
- **Minimum length**: 6 characters (can be increased)
- **Bcrypt hashing**: 12 salt rounds
- **Confirmation required**: User must enter password twice
- **Secure storage**: Only hashed passwords stored in database

### Logging
- All password reset attempts logged in `AuthLog`
- Tracks:
  - Email address
  - Action type (password_reset_request, password_reset_success)
  - Status (success/failed)
  - Device information
  - Timestamp

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode
- Reset tokens and URLs displayed in API response
- Tokens logged to console
- No email service required
- Easy testing and debugging

### Production Mode
- Tokens NOT included in API response
- Email service integration required
- Secure HTTPS required
- Environment variables properly configured

## Environment Variables

### Required
```env
# Frontend URL (for reset link generation)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# JWT Secret (for authentication)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Optional (for production email)
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Forgot Password
1. Navigate to login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?" link
3. Enter a registered email address
4. Check server console for reset URL
5. Copy the reset token or URL

### Testing Reset Password
1. Use the reset URL from previous step
2. Or manually navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=YOUR_TOKEN`
3. Enter new password (6+ characters)
4. Confirm new password
5. Submit form
6. Should see success message
7. Auto-redirect to login
8. Login with new password

### Testing Security
1. Try using expired token (wait 1 hour)
2. Try using invalid token
3. Try using token twice
4. Try mismatched passwords
5. Try short password
6. Verify error messages

## API Documentation

The endpoints are documented in Swagger/OpenAPI format and available at:
```
http://localhost:5001/api-docs
```

Look for the "Authentication" tag to see password reset endpoints.

## Database Schema

### User Model - New Fields
```javascript
{
  resetPasswordToken: String,      // Hashed token
  resetPasswordExpires: Date,      // Expiration timestamp
}
```

### AuthLog - New Actions
```javascript
{
  action: 'password_reset_request',  // When user requests reset
  action: 'password_reset_success',  // When password is successfully reset
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Email Integration
To enable production-ready email sending:

1. Install email package:
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

2. Create email service:
```javascript
// backend/services/EmailService.js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const sendPasswordResetEmail = async (email, resetUrl) => {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: process.env.EMAIL_SERVICE,
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
    }
  });

  await transporter.sendMail({
    from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    to: email,
    subject: 'Password Reset - EduKanban',
    html: `
      <h1>Password Reset Request</h1>
      <p>Click the link below to reset your password:</p>
      <a href="${resetUrl}">Reset Password</a>
      <p>This link will expire in 1 hour.</p>
      <p>If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.</p>
    `
  });
};
```

3. Update forgot-password route to call email service

### Additional Features
- Rate limiting on password reset requests
- Password strength meter on reset page
- Email verification before password reset
- Security questions
- SMS-based verification (2FA)
- Password history (prevent reusing old passwords)
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Invalid or expired reset token"
- **Cause**: Token has expired (>1 hour) or doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Request a new reset token

**Issue**: Reset URL not showing in development
- **Cause**: NODE_ENV not set to 'development'
- **Solution**: Check .env file and restart server

**Issue**: Can't find reset password page
- **Cause**: Frontend routing not configured
- **Solution**: Ensure App.jsx includes ResetPasswordPage route

**Issue**: Password not updating
- **Cause**: Token validation failed or database error
- **Solution**: Check server logs for specific error

## Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ Tokens are cryptographically secure
✅ Tokens are hashed before storage
✅ Tokens expire after 1 hour
✅ Tokens are single-use only
✅ No user enumeration (consistent responses)
✅ Password requirements enforced
✅ All attempts are logged
✅ HTTPS recommended for production
✅ Rate limiting available (via existing middleware)
✅ Input validation and sanitization

## Conclusion

The password reset feature is now fully functional and ready for testing. For production deployment, integrate an email service to send reset links to users' inboxes.
