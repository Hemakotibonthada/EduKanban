# PWA Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App:

## Required Icons:
- `icon-192x192.png` - Standard PWA icon (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512x512.png` - Large PWA icon (512x512 pixels)
- `icon-144x144.png` - Apple touch icon (144x144 pixels)
- `icon-152x152.png` - Apple touch icon (152x152 pixels)
- `icon-180x180.png` - Apple touch icon (180x180 pixels)

## How to Generate Icons:
1. Create a base icon image (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Use an online tool like:
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.pwabuilder.com/
   - https://favicon.io/

3. Download the generated icons and place them in this directory

## Current Status:
⚠️ Icons are currently not configured. The app will work fine without them, but PWA installation features may be limited.

The manifest.json file may reference these icons for PWA installation prompts.
