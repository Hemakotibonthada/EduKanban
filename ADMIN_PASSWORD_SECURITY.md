## 🔐 Backend Integration (Future)

Body: {
  currentPassword: "admin@001",
  newPassword: "Admin@2025!"
}

Response: {
  success: true,
  message: "Password changed successfully"
}
```

### **Security Measures:**
- Hash passwords with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10+)
- Validate current password before change
